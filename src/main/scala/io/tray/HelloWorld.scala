# Excercise

- Write a case class containing a position and a username (both are strings)
    - Write a function to replace the position
    - Obviously with tests (verify the original case class wasn't changed)
    - add a counter field that counts how many times the object changed position
- Add a new case class that only contains the username
    - both case classes need to implement the same trait (trait contains the username)
